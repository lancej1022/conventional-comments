## 🎯 The Problem

Code reviews are crucial for maintaining code quality, but they often suffer from:
- Ambiguous or unclear feedback
- Misunderstandings about comment severity
- Difficulty in parsing and tracking different types of feedback
- Inconsistent commenting styles across team members

## 💡 The Solution

*Conventional Comments - by Pullpo* brings the power of [Conventional Comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/) directly into your GitHub and GitLab workflow. It adds a sleek, intuitive toolbar to every comment box, making it easy to:

- Add standardized labels to your comments (praise, suggestion, issue, etc.)
- Include decorators for additional context (non-blocking, blocking, if-minor)
- Maintain consistent formatting across all review comments
- Toggle between plain text and badge-style formatting

## ✨ Features
